                <q> My experience at the GoodShed has been amazing! Christian has a great way of bringing your 
                    music to life and does it in a way that's intuitive to you. He hears it the way you want it 
                    heard, which is a quality that's very rare and hard to find in a music producer. I highly 
                    recommend starting here, whether you are recording your first song or 10th album.
